ardumashtun_opl_v1 is the first attempt to build the mash tun controller using the PCBA service by seeedstudio. 
It works, there are however improvements which we might make in a future version.

Possible Improvements

* Label pin header on silk screen
* Add voltage divider on digital pin 0 for use as 3.3 V serial
